Theory Exercises

Here are the theoretical exercises.
Keep in mind that each multiple-choice question has only one correct answer.

What is the purpose of linear regression?

**A) To model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.**

B) To predict a dependent variable only from a constant value.

C) To create a polynomial equation to model the relationship between variables.

D) To reduce the number of variables by penalizing large coefficients.

What is the key difference between simple and multiple linear regression?

A) Simple regression uses one dependent variable, while multiple regression uses two or more.

**B) Simple regression uses one independent variable, while multiple regression uses two or more.**

C) Simple regression is linear, while multiple regression is non-linear.

D) Simple regression uses shrinkage methods, while multiple regression does not.

What is polynomial regression used for?

**A) To capture non-linear relationships between variables.**

B) To reduce multicollinearity in linear models.

C) To simplify a model with too many variables.

D) To apply penalties to large coefficients in the model.

What is the purpose of Ridge and Lasso regression?

A) To handle non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms.

**B) To reduce multicollinearity and prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.**

C) To model relationships with multiple dependent variables.

D) To apply diagnostics to check for outliers and residuals.

Which diagnostic metric checks for multicollinearity among predictors in a regression model?

A) Mean Squared Error (MSE)

B) R-squared

**C) Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**

D) Adjusted R-squared
