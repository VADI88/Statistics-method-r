What is the main purpose of classification methods?

A) To predict continuous outcomes.

**B) To predict categorical outcomes based on input data.**

C) To model relationships between independent variables.

D) To reduce the number of features in a data set.

What is the key difference between binary and multinomial logistic regression?

**A) Binary logistic regression is used for two classes, while multinomial logistic regression is used for three or more classes.**

B) Binary logistic regression models probabilities, while multinomial logistic regression models continuous outcomes.

C) Multinomial logistic regression is more accurate than binary logistic regression.

D) Binary logistic regression requires a confusion matrix, while multinomial logistic regression does not.

What is a key feature of decision trees?

A) They always produce the most accurate results without overfitting.

**B) They split data based on the most significant features and are easy to interpret.**

C) They require the data to be normalized before use.

D) They can only handle binary outcomes.

How does a Random Forest improve model performance?

**A) By using multiple decision trees and averaging their predictions.**

B) By pruning trees to prevent overfitting.

C) By limiting the number of features in the model.

D) By applying logistic regression at each step of tree building.

What is the purpose of a confusion matrix in model evaluation?

A) To reduce overfitting in decision trees.

**B) To evaluate the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by a classification model.**

C) To visualize the modelâ€™s decision boundaries.

D) To determine whether a model is suitable for regression problems.
