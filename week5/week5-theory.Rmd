Theory Exercises

Here are the theoretical exercises.
Keep in mind that each multiple-choice question has only one correct answer.

What is a key advantage of nonparametric methods?

A) They assume data is normally distributed.

B) They are more powerful than parametric methods for normally distributed data.

**C) They do not require the data to follow a normal distribution.**

D) They always provide parameter estimates.

Which nonparametric test is an alternative to the paired t-test?

A) Mann-Whitney U Test

B) Kruskal-Wallis Test

**C) Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**

D) Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation

What is the purpose of the Mann-Whitney U Test?

A) To compare two related samples or matched pairs.

**B) To compare two independent groups based on ranks.**

C) To test for the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables.

D) To generalize the comparison of more than two groups.

What is the Kruskal-Wallis Test used for?

A) To compare the variance between groups to the variance within groups.

B) To measure the linear association between two variables.

**C) To compare more than two groups using ranks as an alternative to ANOVA.**

D) To estimate the sampling distribution using resampling techniques.

What is the main purpose of the Bootstrap Resampling method?

A) To compare the variance between two or more groups.

**B) To estimate the sampling distribution of a point estimate by resampling with replacement.**

C) To reduce multicollinearity among variables in a regression model.

D) To test the strength of association between two ranked variables.
